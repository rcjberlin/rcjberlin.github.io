# rcjberlin.github.io

This repository contains the code for the website which can be found on https://rcjberlin.github.io.
It shows the results for RCJ Berlin Rescue (Line + Maze).

The page consists of multiple tabs where either some text elements or a table is displayed.
Tables are displaying the current results and can be sorted by columns.
The tabs can be set to switch automatically (e.g. showing results on a public screen) by either calling the `startAutoSwitchingTabs()` function from console or by setting the URL parameter `autoswitch` (e.g. https://rcjberlin.github.io/?autoswitch=20).

For some more general documentation about software used at RCJ Berlin please check out https://github.com/rcjberlin/general.
